# BracketsInterpreter
A class 12 project where I designed my own language called Brackets, created a syntax for it supporting basic features like loops, if-elseif-else clause, and 1D arrays. Simplified the number of datatypes and created num and alpha datatypes. 
Finally created an interpreter for the code which consists of two phases - a lexer and the main interpreter. 
Also created an IDE for use in windows OS, to write and execute code in my language.
